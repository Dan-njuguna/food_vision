## Project Scope

- The project utilises TensorFlow module to create an artificial neural network that learns different foods and their labels.
- The dataset is fully images of various foods that has is used to train the neural network.

### Prerequisites

- Good understanding of TensorFlow, and Machine Learning concepts.
- Install TensorFlow.

```bash
pip3 install tensorflow
pip3 install tf-nightly
```
